# **A quick check of the pre-requisites**

<div class="questions">

### **Questions** {.unlisted}
* Have you registered for a `github account`?
* Have you installed `Git`?
* Have you installed `R`? Do you have the latest version?
* Have you installed `RStudio`? Do you have the latest version?

</div>
</br>


If you can answer all of the above questions as `YES`, you are all set to go. Else please go back and refer to `Set-up` tabs.
<br><br>**Please note** 
<br>* This is a code-along master class. However due to limited time, we will not be in a position to address individual queries. 
<br>* The expectation is that we will try to introduce the attendies to all basic steps required to backup and version control `R markdown` files using the `RStudio` environment. <br>* The attendies can either try and follow the process and/or get back to us with specific queries after the master-class. We will then try and respond to all the quesries.    

**As the first step** you will need a test repository on GitHub. We will create a test repository and work with it for the purpose of this masterclass.
<br>Please click [here](create_a_repo_on_github.html) or select `Make a repo on github` in the `Git for version control` drop-down (Top menu-bar).






<div class="keypoints">

### **Key points** {.unlisted}

* Failures related to installations due to trivial (or not so trivial) problems are not uncommon - both due to an individuals operating system or even a the indviduals computer!
* If you have been unlucky, to be one of those who are stuck due to such installation/setup related issues, we can try and catchup later and identify the problem(s).
