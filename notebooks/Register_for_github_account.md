# **Register a GitHub account**

<div class="questions">

### **Questions** {.unlisted}
* Do you have a github account?
</div>
</br>

If the answer to the above question is `NO`, you will need to register for an account with GitHub at [https://github.com](https://github.com). It is free!

<br> Start with your email address and follow the instructions.

<br> Here are a few tips which you can follow with reference to choosing a good username.

* Incorporate your actual name! People like to know who theyâ€™re dealing with. This also makes your username easier for people to guess or remember.
* Shorter name is better than a longer.
* You might want your github-name to be as unique as possible. GitHub auto-completes or suggests usernames in some settings.
* Try to make the selection of your github-name timeless. So it is advisable to not highlight your current university, employer, or place of residence.
* Try and avoid the use of upper vs. lower case to separate words. It is highly recommended to use all lowercase. GitHub treats usernames in a case insensitive way, but using all lowercase could work better. A better strategy for word separation is to use a hyphen `-`.

## Free private repos
GitHub offers free unlimited private repositories for all users. These free private repositories support up to three external collaborators, making them a perfect place for your personal projects, for job applications, and testing things out before making your project open source.
