### Challenge 

Write a function to convert map scale. For example, on a 1:25,000 map (good for hiking!) the distance between two points is 15 cm. How far apart are these in real life? (3750 m).

[Reminder: 15 cm * 25000 = 375000 cm = 3750 m]

Your function should take as input two numbers:  the distance on the map (in cm) and the second number of the scale and, i.e. `calculate_distance(15, 25000)` should return 375000

<summary>Solution</summary>

```r
#Declare the name of the function
# this is not a R example - but you get the idea!
def calculate_distance(distance_cm,scale):
    '''calculates distance based on map and scale
    returns: z
    inputs: distance_cm,scale
    distance_cm and scale are two integers
    returns the product of distance_cm and scale
    '''  
    
    return(distance_cm * scale)
```

### Key points

- You can store things in R in variables
- Lists can be used to store objects of different types
- Loops with for can be used to iterate over each object in a list
- Functions are used to write (and debug) repetitive code once
- Indexing
