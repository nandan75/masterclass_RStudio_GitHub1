<div class="questions">

### **Questions** {.unlisted}

* For todays code-along session, you will need a test repository (or repo) on GitHub. 
* If you have previously created a repo on github by following the instructions during `setup` , that repo will work well! However, we encourage you to delete that repo, so you can experience how to use RStudio to clone it and get a local copy. 
* The repo is just a regular directory on your computer. You can delete this directory which corresponds to the local repo using command such as `rm -r myrepo` on command line. 


Re-create a new repository called 'myrepo'
