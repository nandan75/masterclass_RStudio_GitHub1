Training will be delivered online, so you will need access to a modern computer with a stable internet connection and around 5GB of storage space for data downloaded prior to the course. Participants are encouraged to setup a Python environment on their local computer (as per the Setup Instructions provided), but participation using other platforms/environments can be supported where necessary."

Trainers will be broadcasting from Sydney.\n\nZoom etiquette and how we interact\nSessions will be recorded for attendees only, and it is set up to only record the host shared screen and host audio. We will try and get these uploaded to this site as soon as possible. Please interrupt whenever you want! Ideally, have your camera on and interact as much as possible. There will be someone monitoring the chat-window with any questions you would like to post there. Four hours is a long Zoom session so we have plenty of scheduled breaks combined with a mix of content to be delivered as demos, plus sections as independent exercises, but most of the course will be pretty-hands on with everyone writing their own code. We will use Zoom break-out rooms as needed with the Trainers and participants."
